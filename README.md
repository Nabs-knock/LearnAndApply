# GOV.UK App & DBB X-Gov Integration Strategy  
**Version:** v0.1  
**Authors:** TBC  
**Date:**  

---

## Executive Summary  
The GOV.UK App is being developed to deliver personalised and proactive experiences across all of government, with a driving use case to be launched by mid-2026. In addition, GDS intends to develop a digital mailbox to enable a secure, trusted two-way environment for government communication.  

DBB is looking to streamline cross-government data sharing, and by working closely with the Product and Services App and Mailbox teams, DBB can gain insight into integration challenges and help shape practical solutions. Collaboration between the two teams will jointly help them achieve their shared vision.  

This engagement will focus on supporting the App and Mailbox. The reusable patterns are expected to be applied beyond the GOV.UK App use case and will be jointly agreed by all parties involved. The App team will retain responsibility for maintaining technical authority within its domain.  

Initially, the collaboration will remain limited to a small group (OL, App, DBB), plus external departments to ensure agility and avoid delays. It is recognised that DBB’s long-term standards may differ from those implemented by the App in the short term, but this partnership will provide a foundation for alignment and future scalability.

## Current State  
The current approach to citizen interaction is fragmented, with individuals engaging separately with each government department to complete tasks, resulting in a task-based rather than a joined-up experience. There is no unified mechanism to deliver a customised journey, as departments use different identifiers and lack a common identity framework.  

Communication is largely reactive, preventing proactive notifications or relevant updates. To enable a seamless, personalised experience, the government must facilitate cross-government identity sharing, support two-way communication, whilst ensuring privacy and security.  

The GOV.UK App is trying to resolve this, but the challenge is enabling departments to adopt an easy, proven integration pattern with the GOV.UK App so information can be exchanged consistently and efficiently.

## Scope  
GDS intends to collaborate with DVLA, HMRC and DWP (departments) to develop a set of capabilities and user benefits as pathfinder/exemplar to meet stated outcomes and develop concrete approaches to Cross-Government Data Sharing.  

The intention is to progress the following scope to develop our understanding of common patterns, which could be further developed and standardised for future use-cases:  

- Provide the facility for users of the GOV.UK App to natively access services from other government departments, without the requirement for additional login steps or significant user friction.  
- Provide the facility for users to store, access and use their digital credentials when accessing cross-government services.  
- Enable other government departments to send two-way communication to users of the GOV.UK App, including push notifications and digital mail.  
- Enable agentic agents to connect across government to deliver AI-based services.  

### Specific Objectives  
- Develop a workable technical solution to the scope listed above.  
- Provide feedback to the future standards developed by DBB.

## Team Commitment  
X people for X days per week.

## Ways of Working  
- Initial collaboration and planning to be held in person.  
- Detailed design and iterations can be carried out remotely and asynchronously.  
- Google Workspace, Confluence and Jira will be the predominant tooling used.  
- Leadership will be updated fortnightly on progress.
