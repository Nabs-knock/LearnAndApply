# --- Core site settings ---
title: "Learn & Apply"
description: "Notes, patterns, and experiments — published with GitHub Pages (Cayman theme)"
theme: jekyll-theme-cayman

# --- Project site settings ---
# If your site will be at https://<username>.github.io/LearnAndApply/
# keep baseurl set to the repo name:
baseurl: "/LearnAndApply"

# Optionally set your full site URL (replace <username> below)
# This helps generate correct absolute links and social previews.
# url: "https://<username>.github.io"

# --- Markdown engine (Jekyll’s default is kramdown; this line is optional) ---
markdown: kramdown

# --- Optional: add future tweaks without breaking Cayman ---
# Put custom <head> snippets (e.g., favicon, Open Graph tags) in: _includes/head-custom.html
# And small CSS overrides in: assets/css/custom.css
# Jekyll will automatically pick up these if present.
